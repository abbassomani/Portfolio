# Objective
Need visuals on key performance metrics to make an informed decision on raising prices next year.
 
# Problem
•	The client does not have a data analyst who can extract, clean, visualize, and report data for the management team.
•	The client needs visuals on past trends to evaluate market demand and potential effect of a price increase.
•	The client is on a time crunch and needs an analysis of certain key performance metrics immediately.

Target Audience
•	Primary – client (project lead)
•	Secondary – client’s team members involved in the project who also contribute to making key decisions

Use Cases
1.	Identify Key Performance Metrics for the client

User Story
As the head of marketing, I want to identify demand trends based on hourly revenue analysis, profit and revenue trends, seasonal revenue, and rider demographics, to ensure that a price increase will not affect our market share.

Acceptance criteria
The dashboard should
•	List the top YouTube channels by subscribers, videos, and views
•	Display key metrics (channel name, # of subscribers, # of videos, # of views, engagement ratios)
•	User friendly and easy to filter/sort 
•	Use the most recent data possible

2.	Recommend an effective price increase range

User Story
As the head of marketing, I want to analyze our revenue and profit trend to ensure an increase in price will produce a positive outcome.

Acceptance criteria
The solution should
•	Recommend a price range that would increase profits without an impact on demand.
•	Consider past revenue, rider demand, and potential increase in revenue based on estimated price increases
•	Clearly explain recommendations with data-driven justifications

Success Criteria
The client can
•	Easily identify the trend of bike share riders over time and the revenue trend in the same period.
•	Assess the potential for successful campaign with an increase in price based on bike share riders, revenue, and profit.
•	Make informed decisions on the ideal price change to advance with based on recommendations
This will allow the client to make decisions that would ensure an increase in revenue. In addition, the client can effectively increase prices while maintaining their share of the market.

# Information needed
The client needs the top Youtubers in Canada, and the key metrics needed include:
•	Revenue
•	Profit
•	Rider demographics
•	Prices

# Data needed
The dataset to produce the information I need should include the following fields
•	Channel name (string)
•	Total subscribers (integer)
•	Total videos uploaded (integer)
•	Total views (integer)

# Data Quality Checks
Once I have performed data extraction and cleaning, I will confirm that the datasets contains the data required without any issues/errors – the following checks will be performed:
•	Row count check
•	Column count check
•	Data type check
•	Duplicate check

# Recommendation
Conservative increase: Considering the substantial increase last year, a conservative approach may be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand would start to drop. A further increase by 10 – 15% could test the market’s response without a significant risk of losing customers.
Price Setting:
•	A 10% increase in the current price of $4.99, would be $5.49
•	A 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74
Recommended Strategy:
Market Analysis: consider conducting further market research to understand customer satisfaction, market trends, competition, changes in competitive advantage, and the overall economic environment. This would help conclude whether to adopt the higher or lower end of the price suggestion.
Segmented Price Strategy: Consider adopting different prices for casual and registered riders, as they may have different price sensitivities.
Monitor Performance & Adjust: Implement the increase in price, however, monitor the immediate customer response and feedback. This along with sales data will provide an accurate understanding of the pricing strategy and will allow to tune pricing without a set commitment to a price that may be too high.
